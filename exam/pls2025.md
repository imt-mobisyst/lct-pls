## Basic Programming : (7 points)

1. **Write a function that returns the element in a list that are closest to a given value.**
Example: For the value 5 and the list [1, -50, 12, 4, 7, 6.6], the function should return the element(s) closest to 5.

<br />

2. **What is the output of the following code ?**<br />(the main idea is accepted if you cannot provide the exact output)

```python
def generateData(n=100):
	data= [ x for x in range(n) ]
	
generateData(5)
print( data )
```

<br />


3. **Example code:**

Write a short script that prints a random choice (for instance between 1, 34, and -10). The `random` package in _Python_ provides the function `choice()`, which returns a randomly selected element from a given list, for example `choice(aList)`.

4. **What is the 2 outputs of the following code ?**<br />(the main idea is accepted if you cannot provide the exact output)

```python
class aClass:

      def __init__(self):
            self._anAttribute= 0

      def setAttribute(self, aValue):
            self._anAttribute= aValue
            return self

      def attribute(self):
            return self._anAttribute

anInstance= aClass()
anInstance.setAttribute(23)

print( anInstance.attribute() )
print( anInstance )
```

## Develloper tools : (3 points)


1. **Which of the following best describes version control ?** _(only one response)_
    <br />◯ A system for editing text files
    <br />◯ A system for tracking and managing changes
    <br />◯ A programming language for evolving application
    <br />◯ A type of operating system with numbered version.

<br />

2. **Connect the `git` commands to their definitions**

```
push      o                          o copies localy a remote repository

commit    o                          o gets new elements from a remote repository

pull      o                          o records changes to the repository

clone     o                          o updates remote repository with the local changes
```

<br />

3. **Which of the following statements are true about Test-Driven Development (TDD) ?**<br />_(one or several answers accepted)_
    <br />▢You write tests before writing the code to implement functionality
    <br />▢TDD encourages implementing completely functionality and to test later
    <br />▢TDD helps to catch bugs early
    <br />▢TDD is only used for UI development.

4. **Pytest Example:**

Provide a complete short pytest script that test a `sum` function in our `myPkg` package. The `sum` function takes a list of numerical values as parameters (integer and/or floating point numbers) and return the sum of these values. I wan that my test script tests several valid configurations (i.e. several and different lists of numbers).

## Librairies and data sciences : (10 points)

1. **What is an ``epoch'' when training a neural network? Why is it useful to have more than one?**

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( iris.data, iris.target,
    test_size=0.3, random_state=1, shuffle=True, stratify=iris.target )
```
